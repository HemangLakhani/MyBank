# MyBank
A Banking Web Application Using J2EE, JSP, Servlet, HTML5, CSS3, Eclipse IDE and SQL-Server.

ABOUT PROJECT:
This is a Banking WebApp created by me using J2EE. There are two part of whole project. The first part is to make same application using JAVA Swing and Applet interface and second part is to make a web application using MVC design and pattern. In this web application, I have used the same Models created during first part of project just View and Controllers are changed. In this application, a user can create an account online and perform banking transactions. 

User can do following things.

1. SignUp  
2. Login/Logout to/from Appication
3. Can View balance in account
4. Can Deposit money into any account
5. Can Withdraw from account
6. Can Transfer money from one account to another account
7. Can Open more then one Checking and/or Savings accounts

NAVIGATION IN APPLICATION:

Once a user logged into account, he/she will be navigated to View Balance page which will show Account Type, Account Number and Current Balance in that account. It will show multiple accounts too. Now User can navigate to any other page into application and perform banking activity. Once logout user will be redirected to the Login page.

NOTE: 

Anyone can use and modify code in the project. I believe in sharing of knowledge and exchanging ideas. So, suggestions and edits are most welcome and appreciated.
